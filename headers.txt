1. User-Agent: PostmanRuntime/7.43.0  
   - Identifies the client making the request (Postman version 7.43.0).  

2. Accept: */*  
   - Informs the server that the client can accept any content type in the response.  

3. Postman-Token: 51112238-10c8-4d7b-a086-97722f256840  
   - A unique identifier for the request, used by Postman to track requests.  

4. Host: www.googleapis.com  
   - Specifies the server domain to which the request is being sent (www.googleapis.com).  

5. Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br  
   - Indicates that the client supports compressed responses (gzip, deflate, or Brotli) to save bandwidth.  

6. Connection: keep-alive  
   - Keeps the connection open for multiple requests, improving efficiency.  

7. Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8  
   - Specifies that the response is in JSON format and encoded in UTF-8.  

8. Vary: Origin, X-Origin, Referer  
   - Indicates that the response may change depending on the `Origin`, `X-Origin`, or `Referer` headers in the request (used for caching and security).  

9. Content-Encoding: gzip  
   - The response body is compressed using gzip to reduce data size.  

10. Date: Fri, 31 Jan 2025 03:43:57 GMT

11. Server: ESF  
   - Identifies the server handling the request (Google’s ESF - Edge Security Framework).  

12. X-XSS-Protection: 0  
   - Disables built-in cross-site scripting (XSS) protection, likely because Google has its own security measures.  

13. X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN  
   - Prevents the page from being embedded in an iframe on another domain to protect against clickjacking attacks.  

14. X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

   - Indicates that the server supports HTTP/3 over port 443 with a max age of 2592000 seconds (30 days).  

16. Transfer-Encoding: chunked  
    - The response is sent in chunks, meaning the server doesn’t send the full content at once but rather in pieces as they become available.
